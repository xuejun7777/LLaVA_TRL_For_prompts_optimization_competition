USER: what can you see?
ASSISTANT: The image features a large stone building with a prominent archway, which is the entrance to the South Soth University. The archway is adorned with gold lettering, making it stand out as a focal point of the building. The entrance is designed to provide a welcoming and impressive atmosphere for visitors and students alike.
USER: Write detailed, precise prompts for stable diffusion to generate this image, describing everything in the image as completely as possible.
ASSISTANT: To generate the image, I would prompt the stable diffusion model with the following details:

1. The building is made of stone and has a large, prominent archway as its entrance.
2. The archway is adorned with gold lettering, which reads "South Soth University."
3. The archway is located at the center of the building, serving as a focal point.
4. The building has a stone-like texture, giving it a sturdy and solid appearance.
5. The archway is wide enough to accommodate multiple people entering or exiting the building.
6. The surrounding area is likely to be well-maintained and clean, given the importance of the university building.
7. The image should capture the entirety of the building, including the archway and the surrounding area.
USER: Integrate your prompts reasonably.
ASSISTANT: To generate the image, I would prompt the stable diffusion model with the following integrated prompts:
